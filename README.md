**`(Student Developer)`**

I'm a fullstack developer trying build up my reputation one repository at a time. Most of my projects are built from the ground up with the intention of solving real world problems and some are just for fun ðŸ˜Ž.

### ðŸŽ¬ The Journey
I started my journey as with my computer science course in high school with hello world being my  very first program. At the time it was very intimidating and i wasn't sure i could pursue this as my major in Uni. And i didn't, i majored in Information technology instead, not exactly what my first choice but it's what was avaliable. Eventhough the majors were similar, i was still a computer science student at heart and so i choose to undertake a minor in math in an attempt to make up for what i was missing. That along with youtube, udemy and every other resource i could find, i studied on my own to bridge the gap. Fast forward to my final semester as a undergrad, i began to search for universities to pursue graduate studies in Computer Science. After sometime, i finally got accepted to do a masters in Computer Science at the University of Waterloo ON Canada. That brings me here, currently specializing in software engineering and working hard everyday to be the best engineer i can be.
